# Chatbot-Assistant

My take at an AI/NLP text-based assistant. Currently using python3 with NLTK for easier string processing and SpaCy for NLP tasks.

## Instructions to Run
- Follow the steps in `Initialize/setup.sh` to setup working directory path and install the requirements.

- Execute: `python3 main.py`

- Have Fun!

## Status
Here is the current spacy pipeline:

tagging ->

parsing ->

NER ->

Classifier.

NER is the main part here.


Currently, I have found out that the structure I am using here is same across all of the "Chatbot" repos I have found out. I also looked up chatbots for hindi specifically; it turns out all have, again, surprise surprise, the exact same strucutre.

Anyways, apart from the current depression, one big problem I found out, was that there are no bots available using logic; like predicate calculus. I think I can add somethings to that; as of now these are the following additions to implement:

- ** Codemixed user input handling

- *** Verbose mode

- *** Context (history of user input)

- ** Config file
Archiving the repo for now. I will keep working on it as I please (or not). This project has taken a huge dip in importance for me :cry:
