# Chatbot-Assistant
My take at an AI/NLP text-based assistant. Currently using python3 with NLTK for easier string processing and SpaCy for NLP tasks.

## Instructions to Run
- Follow the steps in `Initialize/setup.sh` to setup working directory path and install the requirements.

- Execute: `python3 main.py`

- Have Fun!
